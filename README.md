# Background
Osteoarthritis (OA) is a joint disease formed by cartilage and bone destruction, which is the most common joint and bone disease and is a degenerative joint disease. For patients, this will lead to knee soreness and weakness, greatly affecting the overall quality of life. In the clinical diagnosis of OA, in addition to describing the patientâ€™s pain and stiffness, knee radiograph will also be consulted to assist in evaluating the incidence and progression of OA. However, the degree of degeneration in patients is mostly judged by medical examiners, which is quite subjective. The project aims of this database was to develop an artificial intelligence algorithm to auto- assessments base on the knee radiograph. The algorithm will decrease the clinical burden for the doctor. 

# Data Description
In 1957, the KL grading scale was proposed, which gives a grade of 0 to 4 for the severity of OA as the basis for diagnosis and treatment, and it has been widely used in the evaluation of any joints affected by OA and has served as an important screening tool in epidemiological research. For these characteristics that occur during OA, a grade of 0 is given for no OA, 1 for suspected possibility of OA, 2 for slight OA, 3 for moderate OA and 4 for severe OA. Such classification allows the degree of OA to be quantified into a numerical value, allowing doctors to determine different degrees of OA and adopt appropriate treatment methods.
The database includes anteroposterior knee radiograph assessments of 400 participants in Chang Gung Memorial Hospital and the diagnosis was determined on each X-ray images with the original resolution by a doctor. These data include patients with grades 0 to 4 of the KL grading scale, and the quantity of data is the same among these grades.  This database contains X-ray images of the left and right knees. In addition, on each X-ray image without any personal information.
